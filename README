The GNUstep Unicode Character Set Data Library is a small library which loads
the contents of the file UnicodeData.txt into a set of Objective C objects.

Installation
============
   Install the library as any GNUstep library.
   Get the file <ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt> and
place it in a sub-directory called "Unicode" in one of the "Library"
directories in the standard system search path.  For example,
   $(GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT)/Library/Unicode/

Use
===
   Use the +unicodeData class method of GSUnicodeData to get an object which
contains the Unicode character database.  Then, use the entryForCharacter:
method to access data by character value, or use the object enumerator to
enumerate all of the available characters.  Each character's data is stored
in a GSUniChar object, which has methods to return the data from each of the
fields from its entry in the database.
